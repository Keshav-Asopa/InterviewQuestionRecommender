       "Some background on this: C++ supports multiple inheritance  but C# does not. Multiple inheritance in C++ has always be controversial  because the resolution of multiple inherited implementations of the same method from different base classes is hard to control and anticipate. C# decided to avoid this problem by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces  which do not contain method implementations  but restricting a class to have at most a single parent class. Although this can result in redundant implementations of the same method when different classes implement the same interface  it is still an excellent compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 19\n",

       "PL/SQL V2.2  available with Oracle7.2  implements a binary wrapper for PL/SQL programs to protect the source code. This is done via a standalone utility that transforms the PL/SQL source code into portable binary object code (somewhat larger than the original). This way you can distribute software without having to worry about exposing your proprietary algorithms and methods. SQL*Plus and SQL*DBA will still understand and know how to execute such scripts.

       "Answer 10: (Moment he said this mind was like ok dude I'm Leaving. I stared at them with blank eyes.) They said do you need a moment? I said yes sir  that will be great. Actually this is my first interviewed and i'm very nervous  I didn't sit for any interview during my graduation. They asked why so? I started to answer but couldn't phrase words correctly and I apologised. They said there was nothing to apologise for and that it was quite natural. Somehow managed to say that back then i wasn't ready for an interview as i didn't have enough knowledge and that things would have been more worse than this(pointing to the blank paper). Then I looked at the formula again and couldn't even figure out how I would store the actual values and the measured ones. I confessed this by saying  Sir My mind if totally blank and I can't even think of how I'm supposed to store all the values. He then helped me by reminding me of arrays. I then somehow coded it in c which was incorrect and he pointed that out.  Then asked me to code the same incorrect one in Python but with proper syntax  which I managed somehow. Then asked if dictionaries are more useful for this scenario as we could keep the values as key and their error as values. I said I would prefer arrays as we need to traverse the entire thing both for errors and the values.    495\n",

       "It is the method of dividing a table which would enable a quick reference.  SAP uses fact file partitioning to improve performance. We can partition only at  0CALMONTH or 0FISCPER.
